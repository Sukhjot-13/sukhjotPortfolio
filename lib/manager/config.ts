 *   1. `process.env` in browser code is an empty object, so a plain
 *      `process.env.MANAGER_*` read inside a `"use client"` module always
 *      resolves to undefined;
 *   2. a DYNAMIC read (`process.env[name]`, i.e. any `env(name)` helper) is not
 *      inlined either — it compiles to a runtime index into that same empty
 *      object, and is just as dead.
 *
 * `apiKey` is the project's CLIENT key (`mck_…`), never the `mlk_` server key:
 * Manager derives each entry's `source` from the key kind, and shipping the
 * server key to a browser would leak it.
